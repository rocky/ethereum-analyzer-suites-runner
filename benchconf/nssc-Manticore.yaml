# This contains expected results
# when Mythril runs the (Not so) Smark Contracts benchmark

# A description of some fields:

# The top-level key is the name and file basename
# of the (Not so) Smart Contract benchmark
# file without ".sol" extension suffix

# options: additional command-line options
# For Manticore, we need to specify a contract name when a Solidity file
# has more than one contract in it.

# ignore: skip test because there is a known problem.
# When this field is true, there should be a
# "reason:" field
#
# run_time: This field is optional. When given, it suggests a
# pessimistic amount of time in seconds needed by the analyzer program
# the to give results. If not value is given, then a value is supplied
# by either as a command-line option or failing that through the
# runner's built-in default which is about 7.0 seconds.
# The value is a floating-point number.
